            <h2>App Prototype for Introduction to Human Factors and Design</h2>
            <h3>Spring, 2021</h3>
            <p>For this assignment, I was tasked with making a prototype for a fake news app for Penn State Behrend students. There where three main requirements for the app:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>show users the latest news from campus</li>
                <li>allow users to search for news stories by keyword</li>
                <li>allow users to comment on news stories</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Using the free online tool, Figma, I was able to create the prototype for an Android phone. Figma allows me to create connections between different screens to create a primitive working version of my application. Figma does not support text entry within the application prototype, so unfortunately, the search pages in my app are unusable. Below, I have included some screenshots of my prototype. If you would like to explore further,
                    <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/tVaYXWmKpqP8exFH3iFjAV/PSYCH-244-Project-One?node-id=2%3A2&scaling=contain" target= "_blank"> here is a link</a>      
                to the presentation view of the prototype.</p>
            <p>Outside of the assigned specifications, I decided to add an additional navigation bar off of the home page. I have not designed landing pages for any of the options in the navigation bar, so as of now, they don't lead to anything. In the future, I would like to continue working on this project and make those buttons functional.</p>

                 class= "galleryimg"/>
              <p class= "caption">This is the home page of my prototype. I came up with some fun fake headlines to make things on the homepage more interesting than typical Lorem ipsum text.

                <p class= "caption">This is the search function for my prototype. Unfortunately, I can't really show off what I would like the interface to look like while in use, due to the limitations in Figma.

                <p class= "caption">This is a sample of what an article would look like in my app. In the actual prototype, the text scrolls and there is a comment box at the end of the article.

                 <p class= "caption">This is a sample of what the comment function would look like on my app. Again, I can't show what it would look like while in use, but this is the closest approximation I could make.

            <h2>Comparative Website Development for Introduction to Digital Humanities</h2>  
            <h3>Spring, 2021</h3>
            <p>This project is simply the creation of this website, andÂ my <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/deevans/" target= "_blank">WordPress</a> website. The second part of this assignment was to write a reflection on both forms of website development, which can be found on the "Reflection" page.</p>

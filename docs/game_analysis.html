                Once the player has Tikvah leave her house, they have free reign to do whatever they want with their time. They can use any of the tools (outlined in brown on the Kumu Network) to perform various tasks. Some tasks include, milking the goats and making cheese from their milk, collecting eggs from the chicken coop, getting water from the well to water the plant, and drawing in the sand with the stick.

                Everyday, a traveling Merchant shows up at Tikvah’s gate. Interacting with him allows players to collect mail from Tikvah’s family, who have moved to big cities. Additionally, Tikvah can use her goat cheese to purchase hay or more goats from the Merchant. Every interaction with the Merchant is laid out in the Kumu Network.

                The letters that the player can collect tell a tale of a world falling apart. Tikvah hears from many family members, including her brothers, great-grand niece, and grandchild. As the letters continue, they become more and more grim. Below are a few samples of these letters, labeled with which in-game day they are received.

                As time goes on, there are noticeable signs of decay at Tikvah’s farm. The biggest change is that as time goes on, crows show up around the farm. It starts with one, then multiplies to three, then dozens. Eventually, even the crows are gone.

                I found <i>Where the Goats Are</i> to be an enjoyable little game. It can easily be played in around an hour’s time, and it has decent replay value. The game always ends the same way, but even knowing that, the ending leaves you feeling so hollow after your first playthrough that you feel compelled to play it at least once more to try and get a different ending. I think that the empty feeling that it leaves you with is a testament to how immersive the game is. The art style is anything but realistic, but you become so invested in the day to day running of your farm, making sure that your goats get pet, and your plant gets watered, that you can easily get lost in the game. For me, I didn’t realize how invested I had gotten until my goats stopped eating. I made sure to have plenty of hay for them, but they were too spooked to eat. I felt completely helpless, and I felt genuine sorrow when I buried them on the eleventh day.

                The most frustrating part of the game is Tikvah’s walking speed. While playing, I made a chart of chores that I wanted to accomplish each day. For the first part of the game, the chores are all manageable with proper time management, but as the game progresses, Tikvah starts to move slower, and it becomes more and more difficult to complete everything you want to do in a day. As resources dry up, the time doesn’t really balance as you might expect, since you still have to check and see if the resource is still available. Only on the last two days of the game is there more than enough time to do things, since there is nothing left to do but pray.

                I was drawn to this game because the concept seemed similar to <i>Stardew Valley</i>, a farming simulator that I have logged almost 700 hours in. The concept of caring for animals, collecting their products, and turning them into a more complex good is something that I am very familiar with. My experience with <i>Stardew Valley</i> absolutely impacted how I played this game. For example, petting livestock is something that is very important in <i>Stardew Valley</i> (doing so increases the quality of their products). Because of this, I always pet my goats before milking them. I don’t think it makes a difference in <i>Where the Goats Are</i>, but petting before milking is so ingrained in my brain that, even when I thought to check, I always forgot and pet the goats before milking.

                I would highly recommend playing <i>Where the Goats Are</i>. I found it to be a truly unique gaming experience. There are likely plenty of games that have tragic predetermined endings that can’t be changed, but I haven’t played any of them. The world that is built simply through letters to Tikvah is fascinating, and I’ve found myself thinking about it in my free time since I’ve played the game. What exactly is causing this apocalyptic situation? From a meta standpoint, I read the game as a commentary on the destructive powers of industrialism and capitalism. Regardless of the meta intentions Memory of God, the game itself is an enjoyable and thought provoking way to spend an afternoon.

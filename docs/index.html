            Hi, my name is Debbie and I'm a junior Psychology major with a focus in Human Factors and Design at Penn State Erie. I            plan to graduate in Spring of 2022 and I hope to work as a UX Designer. Currently, I am working on creating a mock-up for a          fictional news app as part of my course work for PSYCH 244, Introduction to Human Factors. You can see more details about this project on the "Projects" page.
        </p>

            I created this website as part of my Introduction to Digital Humanities course, marking my first attempt at coding in HTML. I'm overall happy with how it has turned out, but I hope to continue to make improvements as time goes on. In addition to this website, I built another one on WordPress, which is linked on the "Reflection" page.
        </p>

            <p class="essay">
                Web development was completely new to me before this assignment. When creating a website from scratch on GitHub using HTML and CSS code, the most difficult part was just getting down the coding basics. I’ve coded before, but the syntax of HTML and CSS is very different from anything I’ve worked on in the past. Once I gained an understanding of how different tags and elements worked, I found coding with HTML and CSS to be fairly easy. If I didn’t know how to code something specific in, it was very easy to find resources online with sample code and troubleshooting ideas. The same cannot be said for WordPress. The most difficult part of using WordPress was, more me at least, just trying to make the site resemble something presentable. The UI is far from user-friendly, and it takes a lot of guess-and-check work to make something even remotely similar to what you envisioned.

                Building a website on GitHub allows for complete freedom in terms of design. With enough fiddling and troubleshooting, you can make your website look exactly how you want it, or at least pretty darn close. It’s very easy to make subtle changes, and test new things without losing old code, since you can just comment code out. One advantage WordPress does have over GitHub is that website development can happen pretty quickly if you’re not too picky about formatting. Once you understand how the dashboard on the back-end works, adding new content is simple. WordPress is good for creating professional looking websites that are actually quick-and-dirty.

            <p class="essay">The most difficult challenges I had building my GitHub site were getting elements to sit next to each other on the webpage. For example, on my Home page, I had a lot of difficulty getting my introduction and picture to display next to each other. I had to learn how to use the flex property in CSS to get the formatting correct, as well as fiddle around for about an hour trying to get a border to fit snugly around my image. My success in figuring this out helped me in creating a format for my gallery of images on the “Projects” page that I was happy with. WordPress has many premade themes that users can pick from to build their website around. The issues arise when you realize that each theme has different elements that you are actually allowed to edit. If you like a theme except for one little thing, but you can’t change it, then you’re either stuck with the thing you dislike, or you have to find a new theme that has its own set of issues. There is one theme, Divi, that allows users far more freedom than other themes, however, it doesn’t provide enough freedom. I think I spent approximately five hours fighting with the Divi theme to make something that I was happy with before giving up and abandoning it. In addition to all of this, it is so easy to get lost in all the different menus and it can sometimes be impossible to find your way back to a page that you accidentally navigated away from. My entire experience with WordPress was challenging and frustrating.

                One thing that one needs to learn about and be aware of in any type of web development is accessibility. It is important to ensure that your images have alt text for individuals who use screen readers due to blindness or other sight related issues. It is also important that your website has high contrast, so that people who are colorblind can still read your site. Similarly, you have to ensure that your color choices are easy on the eyes of anyone viewing your site, color deficient or not. Another skill that is necessary for web development is patience. Regardless of the tools you are using, things are going to go wrong. Troubleshooting can be easy and take only a minute, or it can be excruciating and take hours. It is important to know how to handle repeated failure, as well as know when to walk away for a few minutes.

                As I continue to develop my GitHub website, I really want to figure out how to make it look less like it was developed in the early 2000s. I’m not sure if this is possible with just HTML and CSS alone, but I’m excited to figure it out and learn new code to continue to improve my website. Additionally, for other websites that I make in the future, I want to understand all of the information in the “head” element at the top of each HTML page. This website was built on the foundation of a sample website, so I never needed to understand that part of my code. As for WordPress, I want to figure out how to never have to use it again. However, since that likely isn’t very realistic, I want to figure out how to work with the back-end UI better. The way WordPress is set up is not at all intuitive to me, so I need more practice in understanding it. Maybe (and this is a big maybe) in the future, I will try to use the Divi theme again to try and make a more personalized WordPress site.
